# fmtclip
Formats text (code) in the clipboard, converting 2-space leading indentation to 4 spaces. This is Mac only, for now.

## Usage:
```bash
chmod +x fmtclip
<copy some code to the clipboard, containing 2-space leading indents>
fmtclip
<the clipboard now contains code with 4-space leading indents>
```

(yes, I know this is silly ... it was for a very specific use case)
